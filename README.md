# Generative AI & Data Science with Amazon SageMaker on AWS

## Description

This workshop shows AWS users how to use Amazon SageMaker and other associated services to build, train, and deploy generative AI models. These labs go through data science topics such as data processing at scale, model fine-tuning, real-time model deployment, and MLOps practices all through a generative AI lens.

Distributed data processing
---------------------------
In this workflow, we will use the [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) for labs related to data processing as it contains a very large corpus of ~150 million customer reviews. This is useful for showcasing SageMaker's distributed processing abilities which can be extended to many large datasets. 

Fine-tuning FLAN-T5 for summarizing conversation dialog 
-------------------------------------------------------
After the data processing sections, we will build our FLAN-T5 based NLP model using the [dialogsum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/knkarthick/dialogsum) dataset from HuggingFace which contains ~15k examples of dialogue with associated summarizations.
